  <p className="text-neutral-700 mt-4 max-w-2xl">
    I'm an independent digital developer who builds clean, fast, and psychology-driven web experiences.
    I focus on clarity, balance, and precision — every element on a page should exist for a reason and serve a purpose.
  </p>

  <p className="text-neutral-700 mt-4 max-w-2xl">
    My work blends modern web technologies with a grounded understanding of human behavior.
    I design systems that are minimal yet impactful, structured yet intuitive — websites that don’t just look polished,
    but actually communicate and convert.
  </p>

  <p className="text-neutral-700 mt-4 max-w-2xl">
    Whether it’s building interfaces, refining user flow, or shaping brand perception online,
    I approach each project with calm precision and a focus on meaningful results.
  </p>

  <p className="text-neutral-700 mt-4 max-w-2xl">
    Based in Bali and working remotely worldwide, I create digital products that merge logic, aesthetics, and intent —
    made for people, not algorithms.
